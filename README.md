## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

- The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.  Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.  In this analysis I have employed different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, youâ€™ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once done, evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results:

- There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models 

- (Balanced Accuracy Scores, Confusion Matrixes and Imbalanced Classification Reports)

- RandomOverSampler model

## Summary:

- There is a summary of the results 

- There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
