 - Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis 

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

- The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.  Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.


## Results:

- There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models 

## Summary:

- There is a summary of the results 

- There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
